# EnvOpenTorch
 A open source rechargable LED Torch

## Notes
This design is a bit jank and can certaily do with some improvement, If you feel like doing that then please do so and make a PR.

Generally speaking is to have a decently powerful open source LED torch, Im hoping for 10K lumens and some basic brightness control, anything else is bonnus features but there are some i'd like such as PD charging and being able to act as a battery bank if needed.

## Future plans
Im probably going to sell this as a full unit or kit other than the need to supply your own cells, I havent decided on 3S2P or 6S1P but for the time being the charge circuit can handle upto 4S.
